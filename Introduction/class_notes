    - Interview Q&A

bower:
-----
    - bower is the automation tool used to download the required
      dependencies to develop web application.

    - bower is the automation tool provided by nodejs.

installation of bower:
----------------------
>npm install -g bower

[Note : automatically bower will install with the following
        version

        -- bower@1.8.0
]


bower component:
----------------
    - "bower.json" file called as bower component.

    - this component used to maintain the required dependencies
      to develop web application.

bower.json
----------
{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "dependencies":{
        "angular":"latest",
        "bootstrap":"latest"
            --
            --
            --
    }
}

execution of bower component:
-----------------------------
>bower install

installation of dependencies dynamically
----------------------------------------
>bower install bootstrap --save

uninstall the dependencies dynamically
--------------------------------------
>bower uninstall angular --save

know the available dependencies in project
------------------------------------------
>bower list



angular framework path given by bower:
--------------------------------------
> bower_components/angular/angular.min.js


bootstrap framework path given by bower:
----------------------------------------
> bower_components/bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css


jQuery path given by bower:
---------------------------
> bower_components/jquery/dist/jquery.min.js

Gulp:
----
    - Gulp is the Production Based tool.

    - Gulp is the Node Based Platform.

    - Gulp used to prepare the production build.


Advantages Of Gulp:
-------------------

1. concat the files.

2. minify the js files (compress / crush)

3. minifies the html files

4. minifies the css files

5. deletes the duplicate code

6. disable the log.

7. run the bower.

8. startup the servers.

9. watching the front end changes (HTML,CSS,JavaScript,....)

10. live reloading the browsers.


modules in gulp:
---------------
    module : collection of predefined javascript classes called as module

1. gulp-concat
    - this module used to concat the files.

2. gulp-uglify
    - this module used to minify the js files.

3. gulp-minify-html
    - this module used to minify the html files.

4. gulp-minify-css
    - this module used to minify the css files.

5. gulp-bower
    - this module used to install the bower.

6. gulp-open
    - this module used to launch the browsers.

7. gulp
    - this module represents the gulp tool.

[Note : we can download the above modules by using "package.json" file]

[Note : we can install the package.json file by using "npm install" command]


Gulp installation
-----------------
>npm install -g gulp
[Note : automatically gulp@3.9.1 version will be installed]


Example:

Step 1:
    Create the directory structure for GulpDemo


-------------------
GulpDemo                (folder)
    devEnv              (folder)
        html            (folder)
            sample_one.html
            sample_two.html
        css             (folder)
            style_one.css
            style_two.css
        js              (folder)
            sample_one.js
            sample_two.js
        bower.json
        index.html
    prodEnv         (Places the Gulp Result Files)
    ----------------------------------------

Step 2:
    download the required number of modules to prepare gulp script.

package.json
------------
{
    "name":"nareshit",
    "version":"1.0.0",
    "description":"test gulp project",
    "dependencies":{
        "gulp-concat":"latest",
        "gulp-uglify":"latest",
        "gulp-minify-html":"latest",
        "gulp-minify-css":"latest",
        "gulp":"latest",
        "gulp-bower":"latest",
        "gulp-open":"latest"
    }
}

>npm install

[Note: automatically all the modules downloads to "node_modules" folder]


Step 3:
    prepare the Gulp Script

Gulpfile.js
-----------
//import modules.
var gulp = require("gulp");
var concat = require("gulp-concat");
var uglify = require("gulp-uglify");
var minifyHTML = require("gulp-minify-html");
var minifyCSS = require("gulp-minify-css");
var bower = require("gulp-bower");
var open = require("gulp-open");

//require() is the "predefined function of gulp" used
  to import the modules.



//create the task
gulp.task("minify_html",function(){
    gulp.src("./devEnv/html/*.html")
        .pipe(concat("final.min.html"))
        .pipe(minifyHTML())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("./prodEnv/html"));
});


//create the task
gulp.task("minify_css",function(){
    gulp.src("./devEnv/css/*.css")
        .pipe(concat("final.min.css"))
        .pipe(minifyCSS())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("./prodEnv/css"));
});

//create the task
gulp.task("minify_js",function(){
    gulp.src("./devEnv/js/*.js")
        .pipe(concat("final.min.js"))
        .pipe(uglify())
        .pipe(gulp.dest("./prodEnv/js"));
});


//create the task
gulp.task("bower",function(){
    return bower();    // internally it will execute "bower install" command.
});


//create the task
gulp.task("open",function(){
    gulp.src("./index.html").pipe(open());   //index.html file launches in default browser.
});


//default task
gulp.task("default",["minify_html",       function(){
                    "minify_css",
                    "minify_js",
                    "bower",
                    "open"],


});

Step 4:
    Execute the Gulp Script

>gulp minify_html

>gulp minify_css

>gulp minify_js

>gulp bower

>gulp open

>gulp

AngularJS
---------
    - AngularJS is a Client Side JavaScript Framework.

    - AngularJS Follows the MVC Design Pattern.

        M - Model
            - javascript variables called as model in angularjs.

            Ex.
                var data = "data from database soon...!";

        [Note : where "data" variable called as model in angularjs]


        V - view

            - we can use html,html5 or Jade as the View in angularjs.

        C - Controller

            - javascript functions called as controllers in
              angularjs.

            Ex.
                function my_fun(){
                    //Business Logic
                }
        [Note : where "my_fun()" called as controller in angularjs]

    - angularjs released by the google.


Advantages of AngularJS:
-----------------------

1. AngularJS supports modules.

    Module : collection of predefined classes implementations called as
             module.


    1. ngAnimate
        - this module used to implement the animations in angular
          applications.

    2. ngStorage
        - this module used to work with the Storages.
        - AngularJS supports two types of storages.
            1. localStorage
            2. sessionStorage

        localStorage : as a developer we must destroy the
                       localStorage explicitely.

        sessionStorage: when ever we "close the browser" /
                        "opens the new tab" automatically we will lost
                        the data.

    3. ngMessages
        - this module used to handle the client side form validations.

    4. ngRoute
        - loading the target template to source template in single page
          application called as routing.

        - we can implement the routing in single page application
          by using ngRoute module.

        - ngRoute module is the native module.

        - now a days we are not using using ngRoute module while
          implementing the single page applications.

        - ngRoute module is the deprecated module.


    5. ui.router
        - this module used to implement the routing in single page
          application.

        - ui.router module is the 3rd party module.

        - now a days all most all the projects using "ui.router"
          module because of it's advantages.

Ex.

    implement the angular application with the following features

    1. Animations Support

    2. Validations Support

    3. SPA - ui.router

    4. Storages Support.

index.html
----------
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html ng-app="app">

    //We can Develop Animations, Routing , Validations and
      Storages

    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
    <script>
        var app = angular.module("app",["ngAnimate",
                                        "ngMessages",
                                        "ngStorage",
                                        "ui.router"]);
    </script>
</html>


1. ng-app is the predefined directive used to assign the logical
   name for the web application.

   Ex.
    ng-app="app"

2. where "app" is the logical name of web application.


3. "angular" is the predefined class in "angular.min.js" file.

4. "module" is the predefined function in angular class and taking
    two parameters

        1. logical name of web application

        2. array of dependencies.

5. "module" will return javascript object and this object used to
    implement the controllers, services, filters, directives...

    Ex.
        var app = angular.module("app",[]);


2. by using angularjs, we can directly work with the HTML DOM.
--------------------------------------------------------------

    - DOM Stands for Document Object Model.


Ex. Copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using HTML &
    JavaScript.

index.html
----------

<html>
    <div id="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div id="div_two"></div>
    <script>
        document.getElementById("div_two").innerHTML =
        document.getElementById("div_one").value;
    </script>
</html>


[Note : as a html & javascript developer we must dependent
        on javascript to manipulate the DOM]


Ex.copy the data from "one div" to "another div" by using "angularjs".

index.html
----------
<html ng-app>
    <div ng-model="div_one">Hello</div>
    <div ng-bind="div_one"></div>
    <script src="bower_components/angular/angular.min.js"></script>
</html>

1. in the above application we have following predefined directives

    1. ng-app
    2. ng-model
    3. ng-bind


2. angular framework starts the execution from "ng-app" directive.


3. "ng-model" directive internally creates the object in heap memory
    with application data.


4. "ng-bind" directive binds the application data (model data) to the
    view.


[Note : as a angular developer we can directly manipulate the dom
        without depending on javascript]



3. angularjs supports two way data binding.
    Automatic Data Syncronisation between model and view with the supervision of
    controller called as Two Way Data Binding.

Ex.
    in the above diagram we have following server calls.

1. http get request
    - used to fetch the data from server.
    - server internally fetches from database.

2. http delete request
    - used to delete a perticular resource in "database" with the help of "server"

3. ajax request
    - used to synchronize the the data between database and view.


[Note : as a programming languages developer we must make above "three server calls" to meet
        application requirement.

        because programming languages supports "one way data binding" ]


[Note : as a angular developer(Angular1.X , Angular2.X & Angular4.x) , we can make only
        "two server calls" to meet application requirement because of "two way data binding"]


Explanation :
    - At the end of "http delete request" (2nd server hit) database will return the
      "Success" to controller with the help of server and service.

    - when ever controller receives success, modify the model object based on application
      requirement.

    - because of "two way data binding" view will updated based on model.


4. open source code

    - as a angular developer we can customize the angular framework accroding
      to application requirement.


Disadvantages of AngularJS
--------------------------
    - understanding the angular applications are difficult because of no coding standards
      given by vendors.

    - we are missing the secuirity because we are implementing business components
      at client side by using MVC.

    - client should enable the javascript.


key features of angularjs
-------------------------
1. single page applications
    - loading the target templates to source template without refreshing the whole web page
      called as single page application.

    - by default angularjs supports single page applications.


2. routing
    - loading one template to another template in single page application called as
      routing.

    - by default angular framework supports routing in single page applications.


3. directives
    - directives in angularjs, enhances the html capabilities.

    - we can customize the directives as per application requirement.

    - we have two types of directives

        1. predefined directives

            Ex.
                ng-app
                ng-controller
                ng-model
                ng-bind
                    --
                    --
                    --

        2. custom directives
            Ex.
                my-app
                my-dir


4. services
    - services are meant for providing the common business logic to controllers.

    - by using services we can reuse the business logic.

    - we have two types of services.

        1. predefined services

            Ex.
                $http.


        2. custom services

            Ex.
                my_service.

5. filters
    - filters are used to format the data accroding
      to application requirement.

    - we have two types of filters

        1. predefined filters
            - the filters given by the angular framework called as
              predefined filters.

            Ex.
                uppercase
                lowercase
                currency
                orderBy
                    --
                    --

        2. custom filters
            - the filters developed by developer based on application
              requirement called as custom filter.

        Ex.
            my_filter
            reverse
            my_currency
                --
                --
                --


Comparision of AngularJS - Angular2
-----------------------------------

- the vendor for the angularjs framework is google.
  the vendor for the angular2&4 is the google with microsoft.



- by using angularjs, we can create the web applications.
  by using angular2 & angular4 we can develop web applications as well as
  mobile applications.

  [Note : with the help of ionic framework only we can create
          the mobile applications]

  "angular2 (or) angular4 + ionic ==> mobile applications"


- we can develop the angular applications by using javascript(1.X)
  we can develop the angular2/angular4 applications by using typescript

  [Note : typescript is the superset of javascript]


- angularjs have a poor performance compared to angular2/angular4.
  angular2 have a 5X more performance compared to angularjs.


- we can directly render the angularjs applications on browser because
  angularjs internally uses javascript.

  we must convert the typescript to javascript before rendering on browser
  in angular2/angular4 application
  converting the typescript to javascript called as transpilation.
  we can perform the transpilation with the help of "tsc" compiler


- javascript is the interpreted based language.
  typescript is the compiler based language.



differences between angular2 to the angular4:
---------------------------------------------

    - angular2 have the less secuirity compared to angular4
      in angular4 data will be encrypted so we can achieve the
      more secuirity.

    - angular4 have more performance compared to angular2.

    - angular4 modifies the directives to achieve the more performance

    - angular4 easy compared to angular2.


differences between angularjs to nodejs
---------------------------------------
    - angularjs is the front-end technology.
      nodejs is the server side technology.

    - internally angularjs uses to javascript to develop web applications
      internally nodejs uses javascript to develop server applications.


    - node applications can provide the services to (db data) to
      angular1.x , angular2.x , angular4.x and reactjs....


differences between angularjs to reactjs
----------------------------------------

- angularjs is the client side javascript mvc framework.
  reactjs is the client side javascript library.

- angular have the poor performance while working with the
  data structures

  react have the good performance while working with the data structures.
