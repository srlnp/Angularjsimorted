Storages:

    - AngularJS Supports Two Types Of Storages.

        1. local storage
        2. session storage

    - "ngStorage" is the predefined module used to work with the Storages.

    - "ngStorage" module providing two objects.

        1. $localStorage
        2. $sessionStorage

    - "$localStorage" used to work with the local Storage.

    - "$sessionStorage" used to work with the session storage.

    - "ngstorage" is the bower key used to download the "ngStorage" module dependency
       file.

Ex.

    //store the data localStorage
    $localStorage.key1 = {'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};

    //fetch the data from localStorage
    var obj = $localStorage.key1;
    console.log(obj);

    //delete the data from localStorage
    delete $localStorage.key1;




        //store the data sessionStorage
        $sessionStorage.key1 = {'uname':'admin','upwd':'admin'};

        //fetch the data from sessionStorage
        var obj = $sessionStorage.key1;
        console.log(obj);

        //delete the data from sessionStorage
        delete sessionStorage.key1;
